### What we know

* Banks of Republic of Belarus doesn't expose any public API
* Mobile operators are also dragging behind global trends

* National Bank of RoB launched a research into what open APIs
  really are
  * People who administer efforts don't have a glue of what
    Open API is (no developement experience)
  * People (experts) who do the work are probably not skilled
    in public API matters either (no open source accounts, no
    public blogs)
  * We don't know what funding is available, but rumors are
    that the budget is already distributed (and we are not on
    the list)

### What we do

Our goal (if possible) is to help efforts to clarify and enable
the powerful role of Open APIs on governmental, business and
personal level, providing public place for discussion and open
playground for all interested parties. We are doing this in our
free time, because we believe that waiting for something to
happen is a fruitless strategy. :)
