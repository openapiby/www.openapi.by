### Why this exists

This project is started by two people who tired of going to
government and bank sponsored hackatons to waste time, because
these parties do not provide any kind of API to play with.

There were more than 10 of such hackatons, spanning different
years, with not significant results. The whole blockchain and
crypto scene went raise and fall over the Gartner curve, it is
2021, there is an exodus of talented people from Belarus, and
we still haven't got any sane or public API from banks to play
with.

If we need it, we need to design it. Even if costs us time and
money which is not compensated. But in ideal world it would be
great to raise funds and not just do the API, but also teach
others the best practices in creating these interfaces for the
digital world.


### What we know about current status and prior work

If something changed, pretty please send a PR.

* Banks in Belarus don't expose any public API
* National Banks provides some API which lacks consistency
  (sometimes it is CSV, and sometimes a ZIP file)
* Mobile operators have no Open API even for balance checks
* National Bank of Republic **ordered a research about Open API**
  * Researchers on the payroll had development experience in
    REST API and Open API in general
  * Reachable experts in REST API are unlikely to have
    experience in public API matters either (no open source
    accounts, no public blogs)
  * We don't know what funding is available, and how the budget
    was spent. For the future research the National Bank should
    require public profile of all experts 
  * **The research about Open API is not publicly accessible**.
    Under the new head, National Bank decided not to publish it
    for whatever reason.


### What we do

There not much going on, because.. well, so many exciting things,
so little time for experiments. But maybe we should start
bi-weekly meetings. If you want to help - just open an issue - we
are probably all subscribed to get nudged.

Our goal is to design, clarify and enable the usage of Open APIs
on governmental, business and personal levels, providing public
place for discussion and open playground for all interested
parties.

We *still* believe that waiting for something to happen is a
fruitless strategy. :)


### Is this project sponsored

No, and that's probably our mistake. Because money is a good way
to get even unexperienced people to deal with tough problems.
And the problem of ideal API *is* tough. Getting some funds would
definitely burn some desire to measure and distribute them using
the APIs we create. So jump in if you have some ideas.
