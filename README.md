### What we know

* Banks in Belarus don't expose any public API
* Mobile operators are also dragging behind global trends

* National Bank of Republic launched a research about Open API
  * People who administer research don't have a glue of what
    Open API is (no developement experience)
  * People (experts) who do the work are probably not skilled
    in public API matters either (no open source accounts, no
    public blogs)
  * We don't know what funding is available, but rumors are
    that the budget is already distributed (and we are not on
    the list)

### What we do

Our goal (if possible) is to help efforts to clarify and enable
the usag of Open APIs on governmental, business and personal
level, providing public place for discussion and open playground
for all interested parties. We are still doing this in our
free time, because we believe that waiting for something to
happen is a fruitless strategy. :)
